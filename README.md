There is a growing fear that toxic comments are a threat to the community of people
in online conversations. The organizations and groups that are involved in maintaining
the social media sites and online platforms are attempting to detect and reduce
toxic contents, to stop losing members of their user groups, and also prevent the loss
of future users. This project aimed to establish a toxicity classification scheme in online
comments, based on the vocabulary and other characteristics in sentences. In this
research, we take Wikipedia Talk page Edit Data-set to create a classification model .
This contains about 150,000 reviews from Wikipedia articles and chatting sites. In this
work, i have implemented vanilla neural network, convolution neural network,capsule
network,hybridized LSTM with attention layers, Distil-BERT all on top of BERT’s pretrained
embeddings In the end a comparison has been done among the above mentioned
models using AUC-ROC score. we find that Distil-BERT works the best with pre-trained
BERT’s embeddings
